## CHAT FOR CKEDITOR5

Currently under development. Dependencies are messy and will stay that way until the first actual release.

It offers a Chat container where ChatMessageContainers can be added. Comes with a button for your toolbar as well!

#### Installation
`npm install --save ckeditor-chat`
As with all CKEditor plugins and builds, you will need to use webpack before it's ready.
`npm run build` fires off `webpack`, with a default mode of production.

#### Development
If you're interested in development, you can use `npm run dev` which starts a webpack-dev-server. Content is automatically
served through `index.html`, which for now contains a classic CKEditor5 build for testing.


More to come! ðŸ’¬
